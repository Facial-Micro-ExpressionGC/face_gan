# face_gan
An adversarial translator for CelebA. It's similar to StarGAN except not star but single line :) There is no considerable tech difference with multiple attributes translation, but gender translation is most interesting so I just do it.

## Usage:
This repo shares the same infrastructure with my other repo https://github.com/seasonyc/face_vae, please refer to it for usage. Run face_adversarial_translator.py to train and test the translator.

face_gan.py was trying generative sampling, but not finished, may be updated after translator is finished completely.
